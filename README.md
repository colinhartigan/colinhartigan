## hi there
I'm Colin, a high school student from Maryland. I have a passion for engineering and enjoy pursuing challenging programming problems. 

I mostly write my programs in Python, but I'm also familiar with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Luau.

## what do i do?
I have a fascination in reverse-engineering APIs, implementing new features to a product using existing resources, and researching technology in general. 

My top projects, two VALORANT QOL programs: [VALORANT-skin-cli](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-skin-cli) and [VALORANT-rpc](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-rpc), have gained recognition and adoption in the VALORANT community, allowing me to meet and work with some incredible people from around the world. My three VALORANT projects (skin-cli, rpc, and valclient) have amassed a cumulative download count of over 10,000 between all versions.
